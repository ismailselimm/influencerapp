# Git Branching & Commits

- Trunk or GitFlow (choose one and stick to it). Suggested:
  - `main` (release), `develop` (integration), feature branches `feat/<scope>`.
- Conventional Commits:
  - `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`
- Keep commits atomic; PRs â‰¤ ~300 lines net change where possible.
